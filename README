List of scripts:
- convert.py:
   Converts .hdf5 file provided by Metavision software to either .txt
   or .feather files.
   (E2VID was modified to accept .feather files, which are faster than .txt)
   Can be run with `python convert.py <input file> <txt/feather>
- denoise.py:
    Implements the denoising algorithm of Feng et. al.
    Modify the variables at the start of the file to select input/output filenames
    Run with `python denoise.py`
- calibration.py:
    Computes and stores the background noise on a white monitor,
    and displays the relation between noise events and brightness on a color checker.
    Run with `python calibration.py'
- loadStatic.py:
    Call `import loadStatic.py` to gain access to `loadStatic.static_img`,
    representing the relative brightness of the static scene.
    Modify the variables at the start of the file to select input file.
- naiveIntegration.py:
    Can be run as `python naiveIntegration.py`, after modifying variables at start of file
    to select the input. Displays the result of summing over all events, after denoising.
- merge.py:
    Run as `python merge.py` after modifying variables at start of file
    to select the input and output.
    Merges the static background and dynamic foreground, and
    outputs a set of images based on a weighted average according to a motion mask.
- handcraft_events.py:
    Outputs a file containing the event stream, plus some inejcted events to minimize
    ghosting effects from E2VID.
    Injected events are computed from a motion mask + the static scene reconstruction.
    Run with `python handcraft_events.py`

- reconstruct_video.ps1:
    A script which runs E2VID
    Run as `reconstruct_video.ps1 <dataset-name>`, assuming that the .feather file of events
    is stored at `\reconstruction\<dataset-name>.feather`
